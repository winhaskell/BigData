Big Data Analytics at Google Scale

Today's applications are generating an unprecedented amount of data from diverse sources within your enterprise, 
extending out into the physical world where any device is capable of capturing important signals for analysis. 
The volume of data being generated is increasing at dizzying rates. Highly unstructured, raw data can tell a story 
of your operations environment and your customers in a way that we can now tap efficiently at scale. Analytics and
machine intelligence at web-scale have been in Googleâ€™s founding DNA since the very early days. Google Cloud Platform
surfaces the same analytical engines invented and used by Google for nearly two decades to help unearth insight in
your business and operational environment.
