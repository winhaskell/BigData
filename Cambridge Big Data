The Alan Turing Institute is the UK’s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence.

The Institute is named in honour of Alan Turing, whose pioneering work in theoretical and applied mathematics, 
engineering and computing is considered to have laid the foundations for modern-day data science and artificial intelligence. 
The Institute’s goals are to undertake world-class research in data science and artificial intelligence, apply its research to
real-world problems, drive economic impact and societal good, lead the training of a new generation of scientists, and shape the
public conversation around data.
