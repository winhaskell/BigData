DATA ENGINEER

Blizzard Entertainment games don’t just begin with game ideas nor do they end once those games are released.  
A lot more goes into the creation of an epic game than the work of developers and more than you can ever imagine goes
into continuing to build and hone and perfect the most epic gaming experience in the years after our games are in the 
hands of gamers world-wide.

Blizzard Entertainment is looking for a Data Engineer to join our Global Insights team to partner with our respective 
analytics teams with technical leadership and vision, innovation and agility with big data at scale, and to develop a
deep and rich subject matter expertise with the data most important to the franchise.

In this role, you will be responsible for providing accurate, timely, reliable, and ultimately useful data to the analytics group. 
This mandate involves everything from the discovery, access, and integration of source data into the ecosystem to guaranteeing its 
health and robustness within that ecosystem to modeling and presenting that data in a manner that allows stakeholders within
the ecosystem to perform their duties effectively.  You will have a delicate balance in this role: you work most closely with 
the other members of your group and translate their needs into agile, highly-customized implementations for franchise-specific data; 
at the same time, though, you work just as closely with the Core Data team both to ensure that your group does not introduce 
problematic deviations from core data and that the core data infrastructure itself is supporting your group’s evolving needs; 
you are just as closely tied to the Tools and Technology team to ensure that your franchise-specific system usage is 
“playing nice, playing fair” within the greater analytical data ecosystem.  You are one step closer to the business needs of 
the stakeholders and act as the primary technical resource for the franchise analytics team.  Your priority is to ensure that 
the Analytics groups can provide best-in-class analyses, insights, and recommendations in the most timely and effective manner possible.

Our ideal candidate is the druid of the analytics space: a powerful technologist whose dedication to the craft allows 
him or her to morph into whatever form necessary to get the job done while retaining the flexibility to see the bigger
picture and respond accordingly.  The ideal candidate uses the speed, agility, and targeted on-point damage of Cat form 
to meet the quick-shifting, high-impact immediate needs of his or her franchise group before morphing seamlessly into
a Bear form, responsible for tanking the ongoing operational needs of the group as a whole.  A shift to Moonkin allows 
for the push-and-pull flow of ideas between Blizzard Analytics and Core; and the final shift to Tree provides the stability 
and integration between the franchise group and the other users, approaches, policies, and procedures of the overall 
analytical data ecosystem.

Requirements
