Big Data is no longer an experiment, it is an essential part of doing business. IDC estimates that worldwide revenues for
Big Data and business analytics (BDA) will reach $150.8 billion in 2017, an increase of 12.4% over 2016. 
By 2020,revenues will be more than $210 billion.

Much of that is in hardware and services. For Big Data software, in some cases the needs of each company are unique based on industry
vertical. Even in the same industry, like retail or manufacturing, needs will differ from one company to the next, so itâ€™s hard to 
develop packaged software to serve all potential customers across industry.

The key to success is providing the base applications and tools for companies to build their custom applications. 
There is where we see the real action in what qualifies as Big Data application software. Below is a list of 20
such firms that specialize in one form of Big Data building block or another. Many of these firms have roots in
business intelligence, which predates Big Data by years and is essentially the same thing, just not as comprehensive 
(nor was it ever in real-time) as way Big Data tries to be.

A surprising number are big name, old guard firms, showing you can teach an old dog new tricks.
There are, however, some notable startups included as well.
