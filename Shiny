Interact. Analyze. Communicate.

Take a fresh, interactive approach to telling your data story with Shiny. 
Let users interact with your data and your analysis. And do it all with R.

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. 
You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. 
You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions.
